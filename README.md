**mcpartools** is a command-line tool that simplifies and accelerates particle transport simulations using Monte Carlo codes like **FLUKA** and **SHIELD-HIT12A**. Itâ€™s designed for users with access to HPC clusters (e.g., SLURM, Torque), allowing large-scale simulations to run in parallel across multiple compute nodes with minimal manual setup.

## ðŸš€ Features

* Generates all necessary directory structures and job scripts
* Supports distributed batch execution and result collection
* Works out-of-the-box with Linux clusters
* No programming required â€” just basic terminal usage

## ðŸ›† Installation & Usage

`mcpartools` is a Python-based tool and requires Python and Linux to run.

Install and start using the CLI tool:

```bash
pip install mcpartools
generatemc --help
```

> âœ… Tip: See our [Getting Started guide](https://mcpartools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) for detailed setup instructions.
